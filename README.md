# News Site

Project is to create a responsive news site using grid and/or flex box. The result is a news site inspired by my Gotland vacation a few weeks ago. For this project I have focused on using flex box.

## The problem

Flex box, grid and responsiveness were all new concepts to me at the beginning of the project. I had difficulties placing the news cards next to eachother, and in a neat way, in tablet and desktop version. 
I practices flex box a lot during the project and eventually got a grasp of how boxes could be positioned as I wanted them. If I had more time I would dig more into grid as well and structure the new sections with grid.
